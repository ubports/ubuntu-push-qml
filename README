These are the QML bindings and an example app for the push notifications API.


= Building =

The build system is cmake:

    $ mkdir -p _build
    $ cd _build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make


= Running =

The example app can be run from the development branch without installing:

    $ env APP_ID=com.ubuntu.developer.ralsina.hello_hello qmlscene src/example/ubuntu-push-example.qml


= Unit tests =

To run the unit tests, you can use the commands below:

    $ make test

      - or -

    $ ctest


= Automated UI tests =

ubuntu-push-qml uses autopilot (https://launchpad.net/autopilot) to test its UI.
To run the tests, you will need to install python-autopilot and libautopilot-qt.
Then do the following:

    $ cd tests/autopilot/
    $ autopilot run ubuntu_push_qml

You can get a list of all available tests with the following command:

    $ autopilot list ubuntu_push_qml


= Code coverage =

To generate a report with detailed code coverage, you need to re-run cmake with
"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage":

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage .
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make coverage

This will generate a coverage report in XML format (coverage.xml) and an
interactive human-readable report in HTML format (coveragereport/index.html).
