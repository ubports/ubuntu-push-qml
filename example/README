Example App for the QML notifications API. This is an example application
showing how to use push notifications in Ubuntu Touch devices.

Since push is currently only meant for Ubuntu Touch devices, this is meant
to be used in the emulator or on a real device.

* Open the example project in Ubuntu-SDK
* Build a click file using the correct kit (i386 or armhf)
* Run in the emulator or device

= Running on the desktop =

This is more complicated but may be convenient while experimenting:

* Install qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-push-notifications-plugin
* Install ubuntu-push-client
* Run ubuntu-push-client in trivial helper mode:

	UBUNTU_PUSH_USE_TRIVIAL_HELPER=1 ./ubuntu-push-client

* Build i386 click package
* Install in your desktop:

	sudo click --all-users com.ubuntu.developer.push.ubuntu-push-example_0.1_all.click

* Run example app from the SDK using the "Desktop" kit
