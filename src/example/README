Example App for the QML notifications API

= Running on Ubuntu Touch =

Since push is currently only meant for Ubuntu Touch devices, this is meant
to be used in the emulator or on a real device.

* Open the example project in Ubuntu-SDK
* Build a click file using the correct kit (i386 or armhf)
* Run in the emulator or device

= Running on the desktop =

This is more complicated but may be convenient while experimenting:

* Install foobar-declarative FIXME: use real name of the package
* Install ubuntu-push-client
* Run ubuntu-push-client in trivial helper mode:

	UBUNTU_PUSH_USE_TRIVIAL_HELPER=1 ./ubuntu-push-client

* Build i386 click package
* Install in your desktop:

	sudo click --all-users com.ubuntu.developer.push.ubuntu-push-example_0.1_all.click

* Run example app from the SDK using the "Desktop" kit
